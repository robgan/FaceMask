# faceMask
MATLAB simulation for APPL 101 final project to compare the effectiveness of face masks at preventing particle penetration. The simulation is designed to mimic cloth and N95 masks and compare them. 

# Features
- Particles following Brownian Motion
- Impermeable face mask barrier
- Impermeable containment environment
- Graphing functionality which compares different types of face masks
- Ability to create a video file for the simulation

# Results
We found that N95 masks are more effective at preventing the penetration of particles due to the lower frequency of holes in the barrier. Based on our simulation, we recommend that during the pandemic, individuals should use N95 masks whenever possible. However, if an N95 mask is not accessible, then cloth masks are also sufficient at keeping you safe.
